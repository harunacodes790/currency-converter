A currency converter is a tool that allows you to convert the value of one currency into another currency.
It is an online application that uses current exchange rates to perform calculations and provide accurate conversion results.

To use a currency converter, you simply need to input the amount
of money in the currency you wish to convert and select the currency you want to convert it to.
The converter will then provide you with the equivalent amount in the chosen currency.

Currency converters can be used for a variety of purposes,

and online shopping.

They are typically available for free on various websites and can also be downloaded as apps on mobile devices.
